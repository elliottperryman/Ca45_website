# Models 

I'd like to have a page where people can compare how their models do

## Model Scoring
How we score models
### Calcium 45
Maybe a penalty for missing specific effects

## Best Models So Far

### Model Type

Link to best git

## How to Compete 

### Compare
Compete but don't put results on board

### Get on scoreboard
Submit your Git and potentially get on the board
